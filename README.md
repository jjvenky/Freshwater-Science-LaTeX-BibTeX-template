Freshwater-Science-LaTeX-BibTeX-template
========================================

A LaTeX template and BibTeX bibliography style for the journal Freshwater Science. The journal is published by the Society for Freshwater Science: https://www.freshwater-science.org/Journal/Access-FWS.aspx . 

I needed a LaTeX template and BibTeX bibliography style for Freshwater Science but there is no official version and I could not find one online. I have taked the key details from the `information for authors' to setup the basic formatting: http://www.press.uchicago.edu/journals/fws/instruct.html?journal=fws .

Based on the feedback of a manuscript submitted to Freshwater Science in 2014, everything seems fine with the output produced by these files.
